# Fledge

A simple tool for previewing design system tokens with sample components.  Fledge helps get your design system off the ground by allowing designers or developers to experiment with type, colors, borders, shadows, and roundy bits without needing expensive design software.

Once your design tokens are configured you can export the CSS file directly from Fledge for integration into your app.

Built with Vue.js using CSS Custom Properties (variables).
